# MVC Application

This is my Individual MVC Application project. This project uses C#/.NET to create
an MVC application to allow users to create and interact with other workout plans.  

**In this project we learned:**  

:white_check_mark: Planning and execution of a sprint using Agile methodology  
:white_check_mark: Using GitHub to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  
:white_check_mark: Implementation of n-tier structure and Azure Deployment
:white_check_mark: Creation of API endpoints  
:white_check_mark: Testing and debugging APIs  
:white_check_mark: Using foreign keys to connect data tables  

## How It Works

Testing API endpoints can be done using *Postman.*
